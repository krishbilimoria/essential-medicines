  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0\textendash{}100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0\textendash{}100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97{$\cdot$}1 (95\% UI 95{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}98{$\cdot$}1) in Iceland, followed by 96{$\cdot$}6 (94{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}97{$\cdot$}9) in Norway and 96{$\cdot$}1 (94{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}97{$\cdot$}3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18{$\cdot$}6 (13{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}24{$\cdot$}4) in the Central African Republic, 19{$\cdot$}0 (14{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}23{$\cdot$}7) in Somalia, and 23{$\cdot$}4 (20{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}26{$\cdot$}8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91{$\cdot$}5 (89{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}93{$\cdot$}6) in Beijing to 48{$\cdot$}0 (43{$\cdot$}4\textendash{}53{$\cdot$}2) in Tibet (a 43{$\cdot$}5-point difference), while India saw a 30{$\cdot$}8-point disparity, from 64{$\cdot$}8 (59{$\cdot$}6\textendash{}68{$\cdot$}8) in Goa to 34{$\cdot$}0 (30{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}38{$\cdot$}1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4{$\cdot$}8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20{$\cdot$}9-point to 17{$\cdot$}0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17{$\cdot$}2-point to 20{$\cdot$}4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view\textemdash{}and subsequent provision\textemdash{}of quality health care for all populations.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a Model EML that countries may adapt to their own circumstances. We compared the medicines included in national EMLs with the WHO Model EML, and assessed the extent to which countries' characteristics, such as region, size, and healthcare expenditure accounted for the differences.},

  abstract = {Objective To compare the medicines included in national essential medicines lists with the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Model list of essential medicines, and assess the extent to which countries' characteristics, such as WHO region, size and health care expenditure, account for the differences.
Methods We searched the WHO's Essential Medicines and Health Products Information Portal for national essential medicines lists. We compared each national list of essential medicines with both the 2017 WHO model list and other national lists. We used linear regression to determine whether differences were dependent on WHO Region, population size, life expectancy, infant mortality, gross domestic product and health-care expenditure. Findings We identified 137 national lists of essential medicines that collectively included 2068 unique medicines. Each national list contained between 44 and 983 medicines (median 310: interquartile range, IQR: 269 to 422). The number of differences between each country's essential medicines list and WHO's model list ranged from 93 to 815 (median: 296; IQR: 265 to 381). Linear regression showed that only WHO region and health-care expenditure were significantly associated with the number of differences (adjusted R2: 0.33; P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Most medicines (1248; 60\%) were listed by no more than 10\% (14) of countries.
Conclusion The substantial differences between national lists of essential medicines are only partly explained by differences in country characteristics and thus may not be related to different priority needs. This information helps to identify opportunities to improve essential medicines lists.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72{$\cdot$}3\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 71{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}73{$\cdot$}2) of deaths in 2016 with 19{$\cdot$}3\% (18{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}20{$\cdot$}4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8{$\cdot$}43\% (8{$\cdot$}00\textendash{}8{$\cdot$}67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006\textendash{}16\textemdash{}age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1{$\cdot$}80 million deaths (95\% UI 1{$\cdot$}59 million to 1{$\cdot$}89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178\% (95\% UI 176\textendash{}181) increase in deaths in ages 90\textendash{}94 years and a 210\% (208\textendash{}212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2{$\cdot$}89\%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1{$\cdot$}59\%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57{$\cdot$}6 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 40{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}75{$\cdot$}9 million [7{$\cdot$}2\%, 6{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}8{$\cdot$}3]), 45{$\cdot$}1 million (29{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}62{$\cdot$}8 million [5{$\cdot$}6\%, 4{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}7{$\cdot$}2]), 36{$\cdot$}3 million (25{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}50{$\cdot$}9 million [4{$\cdot$}5\%, 3{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}5{$\cdot$}3]), 34{$\cdot$}7 million (23{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}49{$\cdot$}6 million [4{$\cdot$}3\%, 3{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}5{$\cdot$}2]), and 34{$\cdot$}1 million (23{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}46{$\cdot$}0 million [4{$\cdot$}2\%, 3{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}5{$\cdot$}3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% UI 2{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}3{$\cdot$}1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% UI 9{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}11{$\cdot$}8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95\% UI 6862\textendash{}11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018\textendash{}19 228).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124{$\cdot$}1 million DALYs [95\% UI 111{$\cdot$}2 million to 137{$\cdot$}0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122{$\cdot$}2 million DALYs [110{$\cdot$}3 million to 133{$\cdot$}3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83{$\cdot$}0 million DALYs [78{$\cdot$}3 million to 87{$\cdot$}7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89{$\cdot$}9 million DALYs [80{$\cdot$}9 million to 98{$\cdot$}2 million]), high body-mass index (64{$\cdot$}8 million DALYs [44{$\cdot$}4 million to 87{$\cdot$}6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63{$\cdot$}8 million DALYs [53{$\cdot$}2 million to 76{$\cdot$}3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9{$\cdot$}3\% (6{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}11{$\cdot$}6) decline in deaths and a 10{$\cdot$}8\% (8{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}13{$\cdot$}1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14{$\cdot$}9\% (12{$\cdot$}7\textendash{}17{$\cdot$}5) of deaths and 6{$\cdot$}2\% (3{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}8{$\cdot$}7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12{$\cdot$}4\% (10{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}14{$\cdot$}9) of deaths and 12{$\cdot$}4\% (10{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}14{$\cdot$}9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27{$\cdot$}3\% (24{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}29{$\cdot$}7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Such deaths account, on average, for 23 percent of total mortality under age seventy-five among males and 32 percent among females. The decline in amenable mortality in all countries averaged 16 percent over this period. The United States was an outlier, with a decline of only 4 percent. If the United States could reduce amenable mortality to the average rate achieved in the three top-performing countries, there would have been 101,000 fewer deaths per year by the end of the study period.},

  title = {Variations in Amenable Mortality--Trends in 16 High-Income Nations},
  volume = {103},
  issn = {1872-6054},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been growing interest in the comparison of health system performance within and between countries, using a range of different indicators. This study examines trends in amenable mortality, as one measure of health system performance, in sixteen high-income countries.
METHODS: Amenable mortality was defined as premature death from causes that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care. We analysed age-standardised rates of amenable mortality under age 75 in 16 countries for 1997/1998 and 2006/2007.
RESULTS: Amenable mortality remains an important contributor to premature mortality in 16 high-income countries, accounting for 24\% of deaths under age 75. Between 1997/1998 and 2006/2007, amenable mortality fell by between 20.5\% in the US and 42.1\% in Ireland (average decline: 31\%). In 2007, amenable mortality in the US was almost twice that in France, which had the lowest levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Amenable mortality continues to fall across high-income nations although the USA is lagging increasingly behind other high income countries. Despite its many limitations, amenable mortality remains a useful indicator to monitor progress of nations.},
